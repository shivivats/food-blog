I only learnt last year that this flaky "pastry" kind of thing are what's known as biscuits in America. After seeing J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt's [Biscuits and Sausage Gravy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoFkDmTm2uc), I wanted to try making these because they sounded great! 

**Note:** This is quite a tricky recipe to make, in my opinion. I got the confidence to try this out after watching [Erin McDowell's video on biscuits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf4k9jnj_ns). Its lengthy, but she goes into detail regarding what you should do at every step and more importantly, what you shouldnt do. I would highly recommend checking the video out for those reasons alone. And since this recipe is heavily based on [Erin's recipe](https://food52.com/recipes/31811-buttermilk-biscuits), the video will also act as a visual aid.

But regardless, here's the recipe for about 9 decently sized biscuits!

### Ingredients

+ 300 grams all-purpose flour
+ 2 grams kosher salt (for table salt, 1/4 teaspoon by volume and same by weight)
+ 12 grams baking powder
+ 85 grams cubed cold butter, plus 2 tablespoons melted butter
+ 230 mL (240 grams) buttermilk, more or less as needed
+ 200 grams emmentaler, grated (or any melting cheese of your choice)
+ 1 medium sized bell pepper, cut into short and thin pieces
+ 1 egg + some water, for egg wash

### Preparation

1. Heat oven to 200 degrees C (390 F). Sift and mix flour, salt, baking powder in a bowl. Add the butter and toss to coat the butter with the dry ingredients.

2. Cut the butter into the flour till the mixture forms a shaggy dough. Do this till the butter pieces are about 1 cm in size. If you're like me and dont own a pastry cutter, you can use your hands to press the butter cubes and separate them into smaller pieces. Be careful that the butter doesnt get too warm due to the heat from your hands. (If that starts to happen, pause the process and put the whole bowl into the fridge for 10 minutes before continuining.)

3. Make a "well" in the center of the dough and pour in the buttermilk. Toss gently to combine the ingredients and again, be sure to not overmix. You should mix just till the dough starts to come together as one mass. Add more buttermilk **if needed**. 

4. When the flour is fully moistened and the dough is fully combined, transfer it onto a floured work surface and roll it out using a floured rolling pin into a 30 cm square. Sprinkle the cheese and bell pepper pieces onto the dough. Fold the dough into half, then fold the halved dough into half.

5. Press the dough down and roll again into a 30 cm square. Using a knife, cut squares or rectangles as desired. Transfer the biscuits onto a parchment lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 cms apart. Brush with egg wash (1 beaten egg mixed with about a tablespoon of water). **Note:** This would be a good time to put the butter on to the stove to melt.

6. Bake until the biscuits are golden brown, 17 to 22 minutes, rotating the pan halfway. Brush them with melted butter as soon as the come out of the oven. Allow to cool slightly before serving.


As mentioned, this was based heavily on [Erin's recipe](https://food52.com/recipes/31811-buttermilk-biscuits), but I added a few twists by referring to [Kenji's recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-buttermilk-biscuits-recipe). I do not claim to have invented an original recipe, I believe Erin and Kenji should take all credit for this. Rather, I simply wanted to make biscuits one day and I'm now sharing how I did it.

A few notes:

+ You can double the recipe to make more biscuits. In fact, the ingredients in this recipe are halved compared to Erin's original recipe.
+ Using emmentaler cheese and bell peppers was just a way for me to clear out my fridge. I'd say any melting cheese, or even a combination of cheeses could work in this recipe. Perhaps use a bit less though, since mine oozed out a lot. *Not that I'd ever complain about more cheese...*
+ Similarly, you can substitute the bell pepper for anything you think fits the recipe. Just be sure to make the pieces small enough so they dont "cut" through the biscuit dough. Mine were a bit too large.
+ Kenji's biscuits recipe involves the use of a food processor. If you own one, I would recommend referring to that recipe and using a food processor at step 2 instead. I did not own one at the time I made this recipe. Now that I do, I plan to make it with the food processor one day and compare the results.
+ In my opinion, it's okay if your pieces aren't perfect squares or rectangles. Mine clearly arent. I have never been one for precision and I doubt it matters as much when you're cooking at home.

Unfortunately, I dont have a lot of pictures of this, as is the case with a lot of my recipes (as to why that is, more info in [this post]()).

These tasted absolutely amazing. And if they werent so full of calories, I'd be making them again and again. If I make this recipe again, I'll update this post with more pictures!

I hope you try this recipe for yourself and if you do, feel free to let me know how it went!
