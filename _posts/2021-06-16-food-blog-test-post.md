Unfortunately, I dont have a lot of pictures of this, as is the case with a lot of my recipes (as to why that is, more info in [this post]()).

It annoys me that a lot of food blogs/websites nowadays have a ton of text before they *actually* show the recipe, and I dont want my blog to fall into that category. So without further ado, here's the recipe for a 23x33 cm (or a 9x13 inch) baking dish.

### Ingredients

#### Shortbread
+ 340 grams cold butter, cut into 1 cm pieces, and more for greasing the pan
+ 385 grams all-purpose flour
+ 150 grams granulated sugar
+ 6-8 grams fine sea salt

### Brownies
+ 140 grams chopped unsweetened chocolate
+ 224 grams butter
+ 4 eggs
+ 276 grams sugar
+ 70 grams all-purpose flour
+ 230 grams chopped toasted walnuts 
+ 2 teaspoons vanilla sugar (if you have vanilla extract, use that instead)
+ 1 teaspoon espresso powder
+ 1/4 teaspoon salt (I went with volume instead of weight here since this is such a small amount)

### Preparation

**Note:** If you dont have toasted walnuts, you can toast your own while you mix the shortbread ingredients. To do so, heat the oven to 150 degrees C. Chop the walnuts to desired consistency and spread on a baking tray (you can line it with parchment paper if desired). Then put them in the oven for 6 to 8 minutes, or just until you start to smell them being toasted.

1. Heat oven to 175 degrees C. Grease the baking dish with butter and line with parchment paper. Be sure to leave about 5 cm overhang on each side so the brownies are easier to pull out of the pan later.

2. Mix together flour and sugar in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse to combine. Add butter. Pulse till the mixture comes together but is a little crumbly.

3. Press the dough into the prepared pan. Level with the bottom of a measuring cup or any other tool of your choice. Bake till golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven when done.

4. While the shortbread bakes, we can prepare the brownie: Melt together butter and chocolate in a double boiler. Take off the heat and add sugar. Whisk thoroughly and then wait till the mixture is cool (we dont want the eggs to scramble when added).

5. Add the eggs and vanilla extract. Whisk thoroughly. (If you're using vanilla sugar instead, wait till the next step to add it.)

6. Mix flour, and salt in a separate bowl. If using vanilla sugar, mix it here with the other dry ingredients. Add walnuts. Now add this mixture to the bowl with the wet ingredients and stir till combined.

7. Bake for about 40 minutes. Be sure to not overbake these brownies. Check often when nearing the 40-minute mark and take them out as soon as the top of the brownies is set.

8. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Cut into desired shape before serving.


This recipe is based on the [Bittersweet Brownie Shortbread](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020851-bittersweet-brownie-shortbread) recipe by Melissa Clark on NYT Cooking with the brownie part replaced by [Katharine Hepburnâ€™s Brownies](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10782-katharine-hepburns-brownies), also on NYT Cooking. I saw that this was recommended by a lot of people in the comments of the recipe so I decided to go forward with this substitution and it turned out great!

There's also other changes I made, such as using toasted walnuts and replacing the cocoa powder with chopped chocolate. This changed up the procedure a little bit but the end result was so good!! Again, these changes were recommended by various people in the comments of the recipes, so I dont take credit for coming up with these firsthand.

A few notes:

+ You can halve the recipe to fit a 20x20 cm (8x8 inch) baking dish if you want to.
+ Regarding the shortbread, the original recipe uses a stand mixer. So you can refer to it if you own a stand mixer but not a food processor. You can probably make it by hand, but you would have to cut in the butter yourself. I havent tried that as I own a food processor. And to be honest, it sounds a bit intimidating to me.
+ You can see in the pictures that I took out the shortbread a bit too early. I was scared of it getting too brown on the edges, but I think I could've gotten away with a minute or two more in the oven. As always, trust your senses with baking! Every oven is different.
+ Lastly, recipes are a guideline in the end. If you want to go with untoasted walnuts, or use cocoa powder instead of chopped up chocolate, go for it! You can even omit the walnuts or replace them with almonds or pecans if you want to. And if you have another brownie recipe that you prefer, feel free to experiment with that instead of using this one!

I put some cracks in the brownies while taking them out of the pan and snacked on a walnut piece before realising that I wanted to take pictures. You can see the hole it left in the brownies. I'm not a professional, so I think that's okay.

I definitely plan to make this recipe again and will remember to take pictures of the process and more pictures overall this time. I hope you try this recipe for yourself!
